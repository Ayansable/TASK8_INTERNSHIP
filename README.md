Working with VPNS.
Connect VPN
Open your VPN client and connect to a server.
Check IP Address
visit whatismyipaddress.com
IP should change to the VPN server’s location.
Check DNS Leaks
Visit ipleak.net.
DNS servers should belong to the VPN, not your ISP.
Verify HTTPS
Browse a secure website (https://).
Look for padlock icon → ensures TLS encryption.
Optional Advanced Check
Use Wireshark/tcpdump: traffic to VPN server should be encrypted; no readable HTTP or DNS queries to your ISP.
##Summary

✅ VPN changes IP, encrypts traffic, hides DNS queries.
✅ Protects privacy on public Wi-Fi, bypasses geo-restrictions.
⚠️ Limitations: slower speeds, some free VPNs log data, VPN doesn’t block malware.
